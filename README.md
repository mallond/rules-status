# Status - JavaScript Embedded Status Service

## Embedded BPM (Business Process Measurement) Service
Simplistically designed to accommodate different business models by extending a document model.
Scalable vertically in a Big Data fashion, using MongoDB as the main driver for peta byte
organic growth. B-Tree efficient for access, as speed is a requirement. Light dynamic Document
Object model for differing business domain solutions. Pragmatic and embeddable.

## "End in Mind" - Stephen Covey
"the ability to envision in your mind what you cannot at present see with your eyes.
 It is based on the principle that all things are created twice.
 There is a mental (first) creation, and a physical (second) creation" - Stephen Covey

- What needs to be measured,
- Who needs to be measured,
- Why it needs to be measured,
- Who is the audience.
- What are the reporting needs
- What are the Key Performance Indexes


## Types of tracking:

- When something starts
- When something ends
- Cost
- Quantity
- Duration
- Urgency
- History of things
- Projection of happenings
- Internet of things


## Use Case

Provide a simple rest interface to track a process throughout its useful life cycle.
This to include time SLAs, and escalation attributes. The process should adopt general
BPM status of: New, Pending, Completed. The process status is not to be dependent on any screen,
and must behave in a dynamic nature that is wholly driven by the business process. Provide
status as a service, and employ an embeddable mind set in design.
A deep link property shall be provided for linkage to the current status.
This use case to provide a prototype of the Work Status of a simple process,
and will serve as a base design to extend into a more complete Business domain solution

## Requirements

- Restful service – input/output JSON
- Big Data – MongoDB for this prototype
- No SQL – Schema based but dynamic in nature
- Document Objet Model
- Cross Domain accessible
- Encrypted Token for authentication

The actual implementation of this status engine is rather simple. Based primarily on simple CRUD type operations.  The power is in the usage of the MongoDB based status schema. This is were imagination is the most important ingredient.  The beauty of a No-SQL design is the ability of this simple design to morph into specific domain controlled status requirements. It can be assumed that this baseline design is generic enough to be extended into domain specific solutions.


##Schema:

"MongoDB is not 'Schemaless', you must think importantly that it is 'Dynamic.'"

- Organization 			Primary Key
- Division			    Primary Key
- Unit			        Primary Key
- Owner Id			    Person or System
- Is a Person			Is this a Person process or a System process
- Type				    Type = Work (for this Use Case)
- Status				[New, Pending, Completed, Withdrawn]
- Status Information	[Short description of status]
- Priority			    [0 - 100]
- Create Date			Create Date
- Completion Date		Completion Date
- Goal Date			    Goal Date
- Deadline Date			Deadline Date
- Header			    Header
- Detail				Detail – Document Object Model
- Deep link			    Deep link for HTML display and or process link

## Mutable Properties
- Status
- Status Information
- Priority
- Detail
- Deep Link

## CURL Examples

Consolidated actions to to type of http METHODS [POST]. Works with all modern browsers utilizing jQuery

 Step one: Request token /authenticate

 Step two: Use token for all rest service calls /status/[create, read, paginate, update]

- curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"name":"mary"}' http://localhost:3000/authenticate
- curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{add token and data}' http://localhost:3000/status/create
- curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{add token and data }' http://localhost:3000/status/create/paginate
- curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{add token from authenticate}' http://localhost:3000/status/read
- curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{add token from authenticate}' http://localhost:3000/status/update


Now, to go on and sell this to the managers that need the information. As I stated earlier, that the UI was
the sexy part of an application. This pattern can be embded in the sexiest of applications. Good Cheer.
